# First Web Development Lab

This repository contains the first web page created for the **Web Interface Development** course. The objective of this lab is to practice basic web development skills using HTML and experiment with the structure of a simple webpage.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **images/wordcloud.svg**: An SVG image representing the "Desenvolvimento de Interfaces Web" used in the webpage.

## Technologies Covered

In this lab, we explore the following web technologies:

- **HTML**: The basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling (though not yet implemented in this lab, it will be introduced in future lessons).
- **JavaScript**: (To be covered later in the course).
- **React and Next.js**: Modern JavaScript frameworks that will be discussed in the course.

## Webpage Description

The webpage includes:

- A heading (`<h1>`) with the message: **Olá!** (Hello!)
- A paragraph introducing the webpage as the first project in the **Web Interface Development** course.
- A link to the course page on Moodle: [Desenvolvimento de Interfaces Web](https://moodle.ensinolusofona.pt/course/view.php?id=28717)
- A list (`<ul>`) outlining the key technologies to be studied.
- A closing message encouraging creative solutions.
- An embedded SVG image representing **Desenvolvimento de Interfaces Web**.

## How to View

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the webpage.

## Future Improvements

In future labs, we will expand this webpage with:

- **CSS** for better visual styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content.
- More advanced frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue learning and developing web interfaces!

## Feedback

### Lab 1

Olá! O trabalho está muito avançado, mas nos próximos laboratórios apenas podemos aplicar os conteúdos dados nas aulas.

Desta forma vamos começar com projetos mais simples e vamos depois começar a aplicar conceitos mais avançados!
